# README - Packet Analysis Scripts

## Overview

This project contains several Python scripts that analyze `.pcap` network packet capture files using the **Scapy** library. The scripts analyze network packet data and generate results, such as packet size distribution, unique IP-port pairs, source and destination flows, TCP flags analysis, and more. The results of these analyses can be used for network troubleshooting, security analysis, and performance monitoring.

## Requirements

To run these scripts, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- **Python 3.x**: This project is developed using Python 3. Ensure that you have it installed.
- **Scapy**: Scapy is a Python library used for packet manipulation. You can install it using the command:

  ```bash
  pip install scapy
